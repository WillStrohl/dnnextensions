# DNNExtensions

This is a solution that houses most of the DNN extensions that I manage for the community. It also is 
used to display how a DNN solution should be architected as a best practice, which includes several 
very useful MSBuild scripts.  I've presented this as a topic at DNNCon Palm Beach 2014.

## First... Thank You

I just want to thank everyone that helps with the project, even if it's just to use the apps being 
built or submit issues.  However, I'd really like to also thank [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). 
The things I build wouldn't be built half as fast if it wasn't for your generous support.  Specifically, 
the following Visual Studio integrations really have saved me TONS of time and headaches over the 
years, and gotten me up to speed faster on other people's code more than anything else I've ever 
tried (even talking to them about it).
